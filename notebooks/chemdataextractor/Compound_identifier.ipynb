From density-functional-theory computer simulations, we have demonstrated that a 2D honeycomb binary compound (h-SiB), which exhibits robust structural and thermal stabilities, maintains its metallicity by increasing hydrogen coverages at 25%, 50%, and 75% on boron or silicon sublattices. However, under a total hydrogenation condition (100%) on B or Si sites, h-SiB opens a well-defined bandgap, meaning that it is possible to obtain a metal-insulator transition at zero temperature in 2D. Additional calculations show that the hydrogenation on B sublattices is energetically more favorable than on silicon.')\n",

The poly[9,9′-dioctyl-fluorene-co-bithiophene] (F8T2) polymer and fullerene (C60) were used as electron donor and acceptor materials, respectively. The spin-casted PEDOT:PSS films had its sheet resistance reduced from 7MΩsq−1 to 40kΩsq−1 after a single step treatment with hexafluoroacetone (HFA), reflecting in an enhancement of power conversion efficiency in the photovoltaic cells from 0.45% up to 1.30%.')\n",

These AALD ZnO layers were compact, had a high electron mobility of 3.4+0.1cm2/Vs, had up to 100% transmittance to visible light, and a good wettability for the blend. Despite the very rapid, open atmosphere growth method, the cell performance was comparable with some of the best inverted bulk heterojunction P3HT:PCBM cells in the literature. The performance was also maintained after 200 days of storage in air in the dark.\n",

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized in the presence of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), or P3HT-C60 copolymer, using a two-phase, one–pot reaction involving the reduction of HAuCl4 by NaBH4. This approach resulted in the formation of nanocomposites where AuNPs are directly stabilized with P3HT or P3HT-C60. All the materials were characterized using UV–vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and were applied as sensitizers or co-sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells. The synergistic effect in the ternary component nanocomposite introduced by the presence of C60 and AuNPs resulted in devices with higher photocurrents compared to standard devices.')\n",
